# Building Modern Web Apps with Next.js 15

Next.js 15 brings significant improvements to the React framework, making it easier than ever to build high-performance web applications.

## Key Features

### 1. App Router Stability

The App Router, introduced in Next.js 13, is now stable and production-ready in version 15. It provides:

- **Server Components by default**: Improved performance and smaller bundle sizes
- **Streaming**: Progressive rendering for better user experience
- **Layouts**: Shared UI across routes with nested layouts

### 2. React 19 Support

Next.js 15 fully supports React 19, which includes:

```typescript
// Server Actions
async function handleSubmit(formData: FormData) {
  'use server';

  const data = {
    name: formData.get('name'),
    email: formData.get('email'),
  };

  // Process the data
  await saveToDatabase(data);
}
```

### 3. Improved Performance

Performance improvements include:

- **Faster builds**: Optimized build process
- **Better caching**: Smarter cache invalidation
- **Smaller bundles**: Tree-shaking improvements

## Building This Site

This personal website is built with Next.js 15 and demonstrates several key features:

### Project Structure

```
app/
├── layout.tsx          # Root layout
├── page.tsx            # Home page
├── projects/           # Projects portfolio
├── blog/               # Blog with MDX
│   ├── page.tsx       # Blog listing
│   └── [slug]/        # Dynamic blog posts
└── api/
    └── chat/          # AI chat endpoint
```

### AI Integration

One of the standout features is the AI chat assistant powered by Claude:

```typescript
// Simplified API route
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const { messages } = await request.json();

  const response = await anthropic.messages.create({
    model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    system: systemPrompt,
    messages: messages,
  });

  return NextResponse.json({ message: response.content });
}
```

### MDX for Content

Blog posts are written in MDX, combining Markdown with React components:

```mdx
---
title: "My Post"
date: "2025-12-10"
---

# Regular Markdown

<CustomComponent />
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Server vs Client Components

Use Server Components by default:

```typescript
// This is a Server Component (default)
export default async function Page() {
  const data = await fetchData();
  return <div>{data}</div>;
}
```

Only use Client Components when needed:

```typescript
'use client';

// Client Component for interactivity
export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}
```

### 2. Loading States

Use built-in loading states:

```typescript
// app/blog/loading.tsx
export default function Loading() {
  return <div>Loading blog posts...</div>;
}
```

### 3. Error Handling

Implement error boundaries:

```typescript
// app/blog/error.tsx
'use client';

export default function Error({ error, reset }: {
  error: Error;
  reset: () => void;
}) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>
      <button onClick={reset}>Try again</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Deployment

Deploying to Vercel is straightforward:

1. Push to GitHub
2. Import in Vercel
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy!

The built-in optimizations ensure excellent performance scores.

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 provides a robust foundation for modern web applications. Combined with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, it's possible to build fast, scalable, and maintainable applications.

The addition of AI capabilities through APIs like Claude makes it easy to add intelligent features to your applications.
