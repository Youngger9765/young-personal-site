# Welcome to My Personal Site!

I'm excited to launch my personal brand website, built with cutting-edge technologies and featuring an AI-powered assistant.

## What's Inside

This site showcases:

- **Projects**: A portfolio of my work, from AI-powered learning platforms to medical decision-making tools
- **Blog**: Technical articles, insights, and thoughts on web development and AI
- **AI Assistant**: An intelligent chatbot that can answer questions about my background and work
- **Modern Design**: Responsive, dark-mode-enabled interface built with Next.js 15 and Tailwind CSS

## Tech Stack

This site is built with:

```typescript
const techStack = {
  framework: "Next.js 15",
  runtime: "React 19",
  styling: "Tailwind CSS",
  content: "MDX",
  ai: "Claude API (Anthropic)",
  deployment: "Vercel",
};
```

## AI-Powered Features

The standout feature is the AI chat assistant in the bottom-right corner. It's powered by Claude and trained on information about my background, skills, and projects. Try asking it:

- "What projects has Young worked on?"
- "What technologies does Young specialize in?"
- "Tell me about your AI projects"

## What's Next

I'll be regularly updating this site with:
- New project showcases
- Technical blog posts
- AI integration experiments
- Development insights

Stay tuned for more content!

## Get in Touch

Feel free to explore the site, chat with my AI assistant, or reach out if you'd like to collaborate on interesting projects.
