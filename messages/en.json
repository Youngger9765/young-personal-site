    "intro": "👋 Hey! I'm Young, an AI product consultant based in Taiwan",
    "paragraph1": "I spent the last 10+ years building products in EdTech, e-commerce, and NPO sectors. Recently, I've been transferring this expertise to healthcare with great success—leading teams, shipping features that hundreds of thousands of users rely on, and solving real business problems with AI",
    "paragraph2": "My journey started in education technology, where I built products like Vaitor, Jutor, and Cutor that helped students learn more effectively. I led engineering teams, scaled products from prototype to production, and learned how to translate AI capabilities into tangible business outcomes",
    "paragraph3": "Now I help organizations navigate AI transformation—from strategy to deployment. I work with companies that are serious about building AI products that drive measurable impact, not just experimenting with the latest hype",
    "paragraph4": "When I'm not building products, you'll find me writing on Medium about AI product development, speaking at tech conferences, or mentoring the next generation of technical leaders",
