      "description": "Invited as a speaker at UserXper Academy's '2024 AI/UX Workshop' to share insights on leading team innovation experiments in the LLM AI era. As AI technology advances, team dynamics are undergoing massive transformation. This talk explores how AI disrupts traditional division of labor, sharing experimental results and reflections from cross-functional teams, and the impact on organizational efficiency and innovation.\n\nThe presentation covers: traditional digital team division of labor and its pros/cons, reasons and experiments for disrupting traditional division (product managers building English learning apps themselves, data engineers creating gamification activities, marketing managers independently designing chatbots), and reflections on team innovation experiments (What do bosses really want? What do users really want? How to resolve conflicts between old and new approaches? Is resolution even necessary?). Through real-world case studies, it demonstrates how to successfully drive organizational AI innovation experiments through cross-functional collaboration and tool empowerment despite limited resources.",
